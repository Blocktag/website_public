But when you cannot meet someone in person, it increases the risk that they claim to own something they donâ€™t have, fake their location, or pretend to be someone else. </p>\n<p>The cost of physical authentication is high. Raw material cost for plastic and metal security tags like holograms, NFC and RFID have increased.</p>\n<p>Another cost is the environment, measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide released. Printer paper is not known to be environment friendly, but plastic and metal security tags release 3 to 80 times more carbon. And you have not considered its shipping cost and non recyclable waste yet.</p>\n<h2>Printable DIY Security Tag System For Anyone, Anywhere</h2>\nBlocktag's' solution is to repurpose the printer as a factory to make green paper security tags ondemand. People can go to Blocktag.com to download these tags in different designs and print on materials like plain paper, sticker paper, linerless labels or direct on box packaging.","fields":{"slug":"/blog/ricoh-future-printer/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"June 06, 2023","title":"Ricoh Future Printer","cover":"/img/blog/printer_output.png","meta_title":"Ricoh Future Printer Challenge","meta_description":"\"Ricoh Future of the Multifunction Printer'\"","tags":["Ricoh","Agorize","printer"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7b18a86e-10a1-5576-9282-b6e58419e294"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1304996016","2744294623"]}
