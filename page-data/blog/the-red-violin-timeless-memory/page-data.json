A movie \"The Red Violin\" has one answer. The movie's main character is a red violin, filmed from the violinâ€™s point of view. From its birth during the 1600s in Cremona the world capital for Italian handcrafted violins. To its ownership by an English lord in Britain during the 1800s Victorian royal era. Then, its near destruction in Shanghai during the 1900s Cultural Revolution. And eventually, its auction for $2.4 million in modern day Montreal.</p>\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQPzlH1QV-w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<hr>\n<h2>Timeless Art Appreciation</h2>\nAs an art appreciation, the violin lets you hear, touch and feel memories of a past that is abandoned by an ever changing world. The violin shares multiple past life memories of its human owners.\n<center><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/ViolinLook.png\" alt=\"ViolinLook\"></center>\n<p>One popular form of art appreciation is peering through the violin's f-hole to see what is written in the violin</p>\n<p>Blocktag wants to amplify this timeless appreciation for art. The violin's stories will be remembered through Blocktag's authentication tag. A printed tag is attached to the violin. Scan the Blocktagged violin with your phone camera and you can watch a real life version of \"The Red Violin\".</p>\n<center><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/samples/BlocktagViolin3.jpg\" alt=\"Blocktag app scan violin\"></center>\n<hr>\n<p>The shared memory could be a digitized certificate of authenticity issued by the original violin maker.</p>\n<center><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/AuthenticationCertificate.png\" alt=\"Certificato Di Authentica\"></center>\n<p>Or a performance recording by a musician with the violin.

If you buy the 3D scanned model of the physical tagged violin, you can access all of the violin's recorded memories   <a>https://opensea.io/collection/blocktag-violin-nft</a>\n<h2>PS: Safeguard Memory With Non Fungible Token (NFT) </h2>\nWe chose an NFT marketplace like OpenSea to safeguard the violin's recorded memories from tampering. By human definition, your memories are unchangeable. In the same way, a violin's story recorded through Blocktag as digital memory is unchangeable (non fungible). When this unchangeable unit (token) of data is stored on a digital ledger, it is known as a Non Fungible Token (NFT). Combining the tagged physical violin and its digital data forms a physical NFT.

As \"The Red Violin\" movie shows, it is unavoidable that an antique violin is damaged over time. Once damaged, restoration with new parts cannot bring back the original violin. To preserve memories of the original violin, the tagged physical violin is 3D scanned. The unchangeable digital twin is the purest representation of the violin's origins.
