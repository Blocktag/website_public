The movie was filmed from the violinâ€™s point of view. From its birth during the 1600s in Cremona the world capital for Italian handcrafted violins. To its ownership by an English lord in Britain during the 1800s Victorian royal era. Then, its near destruction in Shanghai during the 1900s Cultural Revolution. And eventually, its restoration and auction for $2.4 million in modern day Montreal.</h2>\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQPzlH1QV-w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<hr>\n<p>Violins are like humans. Each has its own history and they have life spans longer than humans. From now onwards, their stories won't be lost in time but remembered through Blocktag's authentication tag technolgy.
