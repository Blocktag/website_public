The movie was filmed from the violinâ€™s point of view. From its birth during the 1600s in Cremona the world capital for Italian handcrafted violins. To its ownership by an English lord in Britain during the 1800s Victorian royal era. Then, its near destruction in Shanghai during the 1900s Cultural Revolution wars.
