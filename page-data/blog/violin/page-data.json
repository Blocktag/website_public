The movie was filmed from the violinâ€™s point of view. From its birth during the 1600s in Cremona the world capital for Italian handcrafted violins. To its ownership by an English lord in Britain during the 1800s Victorian royal era. Then, its near destruction in Shanghai during the 1900s China Cultural Revolution wars before it is treasured in modern day Montreal.</p>\n<p>Violins are like humans. Each has its own history and they have life spans longer than humans. From now onwards, their stories will not be scattered by the winds of time but remembered by an authentication tag called Blocktag printed on the violin. Scan a Blocktagged violin with your phone camera and you can watch the real life version of \"The Red Violin\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQPzlH1QV-w\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQPzlH1QV-w</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/violin/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"June 01, 2020","title":" Test Title","cover":"/img/tag_mockups/color.png","meta_title":"Testing1","meta_description":"\"Test meta description \"","tags":["blocktag","announcements"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b9d1561d-829f-57cd-bfd6-5ba20b2ca90f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1304996016","2744294623"]}
