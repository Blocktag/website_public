If the similarity value is insufficient for authentication, you can visualize print differences with the rightmost column’s similarity image. Black parts represent areas that are masked out to increase authentication signal from the chaotic artifact areas. Darker gray pixels represent areas where the target and fingerprint are most different. \n<h2> Detect Photocopies From Macro Photocopy Resoution </h2>\nPhotocopied tags also have macro differences in print sharpness. The higher the dots per inch (dpi) resolution of the photocopier, the sharper the image. For example, home scanners work at 300dpi to 1200dpi, while industry-grade laser photocopiers work at upwards of 2400dpi. Blocktag’s computer vision distinguishes original tags from photocopied tags with lower or higher sharpness. \n<h2> Detect Photocopies From Different Camera Resoutions </h2>\nSharpness also depends on the camera. Different camera resolutions will perceive a printed tag at different sharpness. For example, a 12-megapixel phone camera captures image sizes at 4032 x 3024 pixels. Below is an original tag fingerprinted with a higher resolution camera (Grayed Fingerprint) versus the same tag targeted by a user for authentication (Grayed Target). The similarity threshold =0.87 is determined from artificially created deepfake tags. \n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/BlueColorBeforeSharpAdjustment.png\" alt=\"BlueColorBeforeSharpAdjustment\">\n        <figcaption><em></em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<p>The authentication target image is more blurred and looks like a different tag with less chaotic print artifacts compared to the tag fingerprint image.<br>\nThe Blocktag app corrects camera focus across different camera models for a fair, apples to apples comparison. In the example below, the same tag’s fingerprint image is adjusted so that sharper pixels are not misunderstood as extra chaotic print artifacts from a different tag. Similarity with the sharpness-corrected fingerprint image is improved to 0.91. </p>\n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/BlueColorAfterSharpAdjustment.png\" alt=\"BlueColorAfterSharpAdjustment\">\n        <figcaption><em></em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<p>ChunMing Chin<br>\nCofounder, Director of Engineering<br>\nBlocktag Inc<br></p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/photocopy-detection-print-chaos-and-resolution/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 03, 2022","title":"Photocopy Detection Using Print Chaos & Resolution","cover":"/img/blog/PhotocopyHeader.png","meta_title":"Photocopy Detection Using Print Chaos & Resolution","meta_description":"\"Phone camera can see things that your eyeballs cannot see.\"","tags":["blocktag","technical","deepfake","authentication","fingerprint"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"87ec96bf-6572-5a82-84be-01e49a37d39d"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1304996016","2744294623"]}
