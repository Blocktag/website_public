Traditionally, violin experts authenticate violins by checking visual characteristics like the violin's varnish, grain etc. Blocktag aims to amplify this tradition by using the digital twin as the physical violin's 3D fingerprint.</p>\n<p>For basic authentication, the original violin's tag has a unique chaotic print signature that is recorded by the Blocktag camera app as a fingerprint.</p>\n<p>For advanced authentication, the original violin's visual properties near the tag e.g. Wood grain pattern, texture, shape etc. is recorded by the Blocktag camera app as a fingerprint.</p>\n<p>For expert authentication, the entire original violin can be 3D scanned as a digital twin fingerprint. Blocktag can guide users to navigate their camera around a violin using Augmentated Reality (AR) and check if the physical violin matches with the 3D digital twin fingerprint.</p>\n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/ViolinOutside.png\" alt=\"ViolinOutside\">\n        <figcaption>3D digital twin fingerprint scan from the oustide</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/ViolinInside.png\" alt=\"ViolinInside\">\n        <figcaption>3D digital twin fingerprint scan from the inside</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<p>As \"The Red Violin\" movie shows, it is unavoidable that an antique violin is damaged over time. Once damaged, restoration with new parts does not look like the original violin. To preserve archives of the original violin, the tagged physical violin is 3D scanned. The digital twin is the purest visual fingerprint representation of the original violin.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/violin-digital-twin/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2022","title":"Digital Twin 3D Fingerprint","cover":"/img/blog/ViolinHybrid.png","meta_title":"Digital Twin 3D Fingerprint","meta_description":"\"The digital twin is the purest visual fingerprint representation of the original violin\"","tags":["blocktag","violin","digitaltwin","3D","AR","fingerprint","announcements"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8534fdab-2c17-5a79-aa6c-1fae692bfec9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1304996016","2744294623"]}
