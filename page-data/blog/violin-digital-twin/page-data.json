As \"The Red Violin\" movie shows, it is unavoidable that an antique violin is damaged over time. Once damaged, restoration with new parts does not look like the original violin. To preserve archives of the original violin, the tagged physical violin is 3D scanned.\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3feDUcDRNAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/violin-digital-twin/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2022","title":"Violin Digital Twin","cover":"/img/blog/DigitalTwinF.png","meta_title":"Violin Digital Twin","meta_description":"\"The digital twin is the purest visual representation of the original violin\"","tags":["blocktag","violin","digitaltwin","3D","AR","fingerprint","announcements"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8534fdab-2c17-5a79-aa6c-1fae692bfec9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1304996016","2744294623"]}
