The violin’s unique fingerprint identity.</p>\n<p>In the 21st century, Blocktag is the printed tag technology for violin authentication. Each tag has its own unclonable fingerprint. When a violin is tagged, you can scan the tag with your phone camera and see the violin’s past life.</p>\n<p>As time goes by, the violin’s life story can be recorded. For example, a partner musician’s performance recording at a concert hall.
