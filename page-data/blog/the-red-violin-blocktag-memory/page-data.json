The movie was filmed from the violinâ€™s point of view. From its birth during the 1600s in Cremona the world capital for Italian handcrafted violins. To its ownership by an English lord in Britain during the 1800s Victorian royal era. Then, its near destruction in Shanghai during the 1900s Cultural Revolution. And eventually, its restoration and auction for $2.4 million in modern day Montreal.</p></h2>\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQPzlH1QV-w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<hr>\n<p>Violins are like humans. Each has its own history and they have life spans longer than humans. From now onwards, their stories won't be lost in time but remembered through Blocktag's authentication tag tech. The tag is printed and attached to a violin. Scan the Blocktagged violin with your phone camera and you can watch the real life version of \"The Red Violin\".</p>\n<center><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/samples/BlocktagViolin3.jpg\" alt=\"Blocktag app scan violin\"></center>\n<hr>\n<h2>Unchangeable Memory As Non Fungible Token (NFT) </h2>\nBy human definition, your memories are unchangeable. In the same way, a violin's story recorded through Blocktag as digital memory is unchangeable (non fungible). \n<p>This memory could be a digitized certificate of authenticity issued by the original violin maker.</p>\n<center><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/AuthenticationCertificate.png\" alt=\"Certificato Di Authentica\"></center>\n<p>Or a performance recording with the violin. Like this 2020AD pandemic era shared memory with a masked performer.</p>\n<center><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/674119192?h=e17aa6274c\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<p>When this unchangeable unit (token) of data is stored on a digital ledger, it is known as a Non Fungible Token (NFT). The tagged physical violin and its digital data becomes a physical NFT.

To preserve memories of the violin at different stages of its life, the tagged physical violin is 3D scanned to create an unchangeable digital twin. \n<p>A Blocktagged violin digital twin is currently listed on the NFT marketplace OpenSea <a><a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/blocktag-violin-nft\">https://opensea.io/collection/blocktag-violin-nft</a></a></p>\n<center><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/samples/BlocktagViolin3.jpg\" alt=\"Blocktag app scan violin\"></center>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/the-red-violin-blocktag-memory/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2022","title":"The Red Violin: Blocktag Memory","cover":"/img/blog/ViolinHybrid.png","meta_title":"The Red Violin: Blocktag Memory","meta_description":"\"Test meta description \"","tags":["blocktag","violin","announcements"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ccc650b5-b824-5474-82ae-e51431bc6140"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1304996016","2744294623"]}
