The movie was filmed from the violinâ€™s point of view. From its birth during the 1600s in Cremona the world capital for Italian handcrafted violins. To its ownership by an English lord in Britain during the 1800s Victorian royal era. Then, its near destruction in Shanghai during the 1900s Cultural Revolution. And eventually, its restoration and auction for $2.4 million in modern day Montreal.</p></h2>\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQPzlH1QV-w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<hr>\n<p>Violins are like humans. Each has its own history and they have life spans longer than humans. From now onwards, their stories won't be lost in time but remembered through Blocktag's authentication tag tech. The tag is printed and attached to a violin. Scan the Blocktagged violin with your phone camera and you can watch the real life version of \"The Red Violin\".</p>\n<center><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/samples/BlocktagViolin3.jpg\" alt=\"Blocktag app scan violin\"></center>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/674119192?h=e17aa6274c\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/674119192\">J.S.

The violin's stories which are digitally recorded is unchangeable (non fungible). When this unchangeable unit (token) of data is stored on a digital ledger, it is known as a Non Fungible Token (NFT). \n<h2>Physical NFT</h2>\nThe tag's link represents the physical violin. The tagged physical violin and its digital data becomes a physical NFT. \n<h2>Digital Twin</h2>\nAs the \"The Red Violin\" movie shows, it is unavoidable that a vintage violin is damaged over time. To preserve memories of the violin at different stages of its life, the tagged physical violin is 3D scanned to create a digital twin.
