It is often used with bad intentions. We turned the tables and found a use for good. Blocktag uses deepfake to digitally alter an original tag so that you can anticipate how counterfeit tags look like.</p>\n<h2> Deep Learning For Print Physics </h2>\nBlocktag’s deepfake technology learns the physics of printing to predict how photocopied tags printed on different printer models will look like. Below is an image rendering of deepfake reprints and photocopies.\n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"300\" src=\"/img/blog/deepfake-for-good1.png\" alt=\"DeepfakeTagSample1\">\n        <figcaption><em>Figure 1: Deepfake reprints and photocopies derived from an original tag. Black pixels on red/green/blue colored background represents noisy areas that are masked out</em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<h2> Deep Learning For Print Material Detection </h2>\nMoreover, print physics differs on different paper types. Deepfake tags can be created more accurately if you know what material or paper is the tag printed on. The material or paper type is also useful to check print quality for users that print tags on home printers. Blocktag can infer paper type by seeing a tag’s surface texture with AI computer vision. An AI model is trained on images of tags printed on known paper types (Normal, cardboard, glossy, photo quality etc.)\n<h2> Deep Learning For Camera Resolution Correction </h2>\nBlocktag can also use AI to customize how deepfake tags look like on different phone cameras. Because cameras with different resolutions perceive the printed original tag at different sharpness. Sharper pixels can be misinterpreted as extra chaotic print artifacts from a photocopied tag. Blocktag AI corrects the camera focus to ensure a fair comparison between original and deepfake tags.\n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/deepfake-for-good2.png\" alt=\"DeepfakeTagSample2\">\n        <figcaption><em>Figure 2: Deepfake reprints derived from the same original tag taken with a higher resolution camera.</em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<h2> 3D Space Visualisation For Deepfake Authentication </h2>\n<p>Blocktag uses deepfakes to improve authentication accuracy. As we collect more training data from user authentications to train our deep learning model, there are more deepfake datapoints to tighten the authentication criteria. You can visualize this in the graph below. The 3 axes represents the target tag’s red,green and blue colored pattern's similarity with the original fingerprint. The boxed space bounded by the 3 colored planes represent successful authentication. Each colored datapoint represents a tag instance.</p>\n<p>Black: Deepfake tag. <br>\nWhite: Target tag to be authenticated. <br>\nGray: Past authentication sessions of the target tag. <br>\nGold: Original tag's fingerprints. The ground truth gold standard. <br></p>\n<center><div style=\"padding:100% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/746033343?h=47d854a8d5&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"Blocktag Authentication 3D Space Visualisation\"></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script></center>\n<p>Deepfake empowers a brand’s users as anti-counterfeiting's first line of defense.
