It is often used with bad intentions. We turned the tables and found a use for good. Blocktag uses deepfake to digitally alter an original tag so that you can anticipate how counterfeit tags look like.</p>\n<h2> Deep Learning For Print Physics </h2>\nBlocktag’s deepfake technology learns the physics of printing to predict how photocopied tags printed on different printer models will look like. Below is an image rendering of deepfake reprints and photocopies.\n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"300\" src=\"/img/blog/deepfake-for-good1.png\" alt=\"DeepfakeTagSample1\">\n        <figcaption><em>Figure 1: Deepfake reprints and photocopies derived from an original tag.</em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<h2> Deep Learning For Camera Resolution Correction </h2>\nBlocktag can also use AI to customize how deepfake tags look like on different phone cameras. Because cameras with different resolutions perceive the printed original tag at different sharpness.\n<center>\n    <figure>\n        <img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/img/blog/deepfake-for-good2.png\" alt=\"DeepfakeTagSample2\">\n        <figcaption><em>Figure 2: Deepfake reprints derived from the same original tag taken with a higher resolution camera.</em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</center>\n<h2> 3D Space Visualisation For Deepfake Authentication </h2>\n<p>Blocktag uses deepfakes to improve authentication accuracy. As we collect more training data from user authentications to train our deep learning model, there are more deepfake datapoints to tighten the authentication criteria.</p>\n<p>Deepfake empowers consumers as anti-counterfeiting's first line of defense. Before counterfeiters try to fake it till they make it.</p>\n<p>ChunMing Chin<br>\nCofounder, Director of Engineering<br>\nBlocktag Inc<br></p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/deepfake-predict-counterfeit-tags/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 02, 2022","title":"Predict Counterfeit Tags With Deepfake","cover":"/img/blog/DeepfakeHeader.png","meta_title":"Deepfake For Good","meta_description":"\"Blocktag uses deepfake to digitally alter an original tag so that you can anticipate how counterfeit tags look like.\"","tags":["blocktag","technical","deepfake","authentication","fingerprint"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"05995cd0-f761-5005-aba5-703ed9a9a372"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1304996016","2744294623"]}
