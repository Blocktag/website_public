&lt;p&gt;Have you wondered why someone would spend millions on art? A movie &quot;The Red Violin&quot; has one answer. The movie&apos;s main character is a red violin, filmed from the violin’s point of view. From its birth during the 1600s in Cremona the world capital for Italian handcrafted violins. To its ownership by an English lord in Britain during the 1800s Victorian royal era. Then, its near destruction in Shanghai during the 1900s Cultural Revolution. And eventually, its auction for $2.4 million in modern day Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeless Art Appreciation&lt;/h2&gt;
As a form of art appreciation, the violin brings you back to the past. You can touch, hear and feel memories of the past through the violin as it is constant, timeless in an ever changing world. The violin is humanized as it shares stories of multiple past lives with different musicians. Blocktag wants to amplify this timeless appreciation for art. The violin&apos;s stories will be remembered through Blocktag&apos;s authentication tag. A printed tag is attached to the violin. Scan the Blocktagged violin with your phone camera and you can watch a real life version of &quot;The Red Violin&quot;.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;/img/samples/BlocktagViolin3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blocktag app scan violin&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shared memory could be a digitized certificate of authenticity issued by the original violin maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;/img/blog/AuthenticationCertificate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Certificato Di Authentica&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a performance recording by a musician with the violin. Like this 2020AD pandemic era shared memory with a masked performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blocktag Timeless Art Appreciation&lt;/h2&gt;
Blocktag is partnering with musicians to let people appreciate this timeless form of art on the OpenSea marketplace. If you buy the 3D scanned model of the physical tagged violin, you can access all of the violin&apos;s recorded memories   &lt;a&gt;https://opensea.io/collection/blocktag-violin-nft&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;/img/samples/BlocktagViolin3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blocktag app scan violin&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PS: Safeguard Memory With Non Fungible Token (NFT) &lt;/h2&gt;
We chose an NFT marketplace like OpenSea to safeguard the violin&apos;s recorded memories from tampering. By human definition, your memories are unchangeable. In the same way, a violin&apos;s story recorded through Blocktag as digital memory is unchangeable (non fungible). When this unchangeable unit (token) of data is stored on a digital ledger, it is known as a Non Fungible Token (NFT). Combining the tagged physical violin and its digital data forms a physical NFT. &lt;a&gt;https://www.blocktag.com/blog/violin-physical-nft/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PSS: Preserve Violin With Digital Twin/h2&gt;
You might be thinking: &quot;Is there value in buying a 3D scanned digital twin instead of the original physical violin?&quot;. As &quot;The Red Violin&quot; movie shows, it is unavoidable that an antique violin is damaged over time. Once damaged, restoration with new parts cannot bring back the original violin. To preserve memories of the original violin, the tagged physical violin is 3D scanned. The unchangeable digital twin is the purest representation of the violin&apos;s origins.

&lt;p&gt;Violins are like humans. Each has its own history and they have life spans longer than humans.
